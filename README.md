Create and manage multiple OpenAI Agents with image upload and database storage Beta Version of streaming assistants api creator and manager. The app runs in streamlit and allows the user to create and manage multiple assistants in a single session. The build defaults to the latest non reasoning openAI LLM. The app allows the user to upload images and have the assistant use the image data to perform tasks designated as instructions. The threads can be maintained between chat sessions. The database is a very straitforward SQL lite that runs in the Google Cloud. The entire coding effort is meant to be a testbed for learning to interface with the OpenAI API platform. The coding efforts have taken over 9 months of trial and error, resulting in a large not elegant code elephant that performs many " Swiss Army Knife " assistants functions. The entire premise is to test the state of the art related to leveraging the inherent abilities of the LLM and meshing that with a coding infrastructure that provides very practical tools for the user.  The idea is also to test the possibility of seeding inherent agentic processes by multiple assistants acting independently on a user input image, and incentivize the user to create and test novel AI assistants instruction sets that encouraged agentic collaboration.
